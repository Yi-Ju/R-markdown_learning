When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded `R code chunks` within the ``` ``document`` ```. *You can embed an R code chunk* like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


(command+option+I)
```{r, chunk-label, results='hide'}
summary(cars)
```


```{r}
# execute code if the date is later than a specified day
do_it = Sys.Date() > '2018-02-14'
```

```{r, eval=do_it}
x = rnorm(100)
```




```{r}
x = 5  # radius of a circle
```
For a circle with the radius `r x`,
its area is `r pi * x^2`.




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r, fig.cap = 'fig1: haha', fig.pos = 'h'}
plot(cars, pch = 18)
```

```{r, fig.hold = 'hold', out.width = '25%'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, 0.2, 0.1))
plot(cars, pch = 19)
plot(pressure, pch = 17)
```

## Including Tables

```{r tables-mtcars, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(iris[1:5, ], caption = 'A caption')
```


## javascript
```{js, echo=FALSE}
# If you are using an R Markdown format that targets HTML output (e.g., html_document and ioslides_presenation, etc.), you can include JavaScript to be executed within the HTML page using the JavaScript engine named js.

# For example, the following chunk uses jQuery (which is included in most R Markdown HTML formats) to change the color of the document title to red:


$('.title').css('color', 'red')
```
